This is a small library that helps increase the pliability of object constructor signatures.
Instead of instantiating via the constructor, this library can install helper factory
class-level methods that you can use with hashes:

* make(): create a single instance of a class
* array(): create an array of instances of a class

One caveat to this library is that it is not meant to be a complete modeling solution but rather
just a tool that helps model a domain or complete a modeling framework.
The main missing element to this library is that you still have to manage and implement constructors.
The two class-level factory methods are just meant to create a syntactic hash-like interface.

## Installation

To install through Rubygems:

````
gem install install acts_as_hashable
````

You can also add this to your Gemfile:

````
bundle add acts_as_hashable
````

## Examples

Consider the following example:

````
class Person
  acts_as_hashable

  attr_reader :name, :age

  def initialize(name:, age:)
    @name = name
    @age  = age
  end
end

class HeadOfHousehold
  acts_as_hashable

  attr_reader :person, :partner

  def initialize(person:, partner: nil)
    @person   = Person.make(person)
    @partner  = Person.make(partner)
  end
end

class Family
  acts_as_hashable

  attr_reader :head_of_household, :children

  def initialize(head_of_household:, children: [])
    @head_of_household  = HeadOfHousehold.make(head_of_household)
    @children           = Person.array(children)
  end
end
````

Simply placing:

````
acts_as_hashable
````

on a class means it will have the two main factory methods available for you to use.  Then,
you can leverage these for instantiation:

````
family = {
  head_of_household: {
    person: {
      name: 'Matt',
      age:  109,
    },
    partner: {
      name: 'Katie',
      age:  110,
    }
  },
  children: [
    { name: 'Martin', age: 29 },
    { name: 'Short',  age: 99 },
  ]
}

family_obj = Family.make(family)
````

The family_obj will then be a fully hydrated Family instance.  The family instance
attributes will also be fully hydrated since its constructor also uses acts_as_hashable.

Note that this works nicely with either keyword arguments or a hash-based argument constructor like so:

````
class Toy
  acts_as_hashable

  attr_reader :squishy

  def initialize(opts = {})
    @squishy = opts[:squishy] || false
  end
end

class Pet
  acts_as_hashable

  attr_reader :name, :toy

  def initialize(opts = {})
    @name = opts[:name]
    @toy  = Toy.make(opts[:toy])
  end
end
````

### Publishing

Note: ensure you have proper authorization before trying to publish new versions.

After code changes have successfully gone through the Pull Request review process then the following steps should be followed for publishing new versions:

1. Merge Pull Request into master
2. Update ```lib/acts_as_hashable/version.rb``` using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
3. Install dependencies: ```bundle```
4. Update ```CHANGELOG.md``` with release notes
5. Commit & push master to remote and ensure CI builds master successfully
6. Build the project locally: `gem build acts_as_hashable`
7. Publish package to RubyGems: `gem push acts_as_hashable-X.gem` where X is the version to push
8. Tag master with new version: `git tag <version>`
9. Push tags remotely: `git push origin --tags`
